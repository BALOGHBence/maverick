      # OPTIONAL: uncomment and update to include your PyPI project URL in the deployment status:
      # url: https://pypi.org/p/YOURPROJECT
      #
      # ALTERNATIVE: if your GitHub Release name is the PyPI project version string
      # ALTERNATIVE: exactly, uncomment the following line instead:
      # url: https://pypi.org/project/YOURPROJECT/${{ github.event.release.name }}
