# Poker Fundamentals: Rules, Variants, Betting and Hand Rankings

This page is a practical overview of how poker works: the basic flow of a hand, common game types, betting structures, hand rankings, and a glossary.

::::{note}
Poker has “house rules” (small differences in procedures) depending on venue. This document describes the most common conventions.

## The Goal of Poker

In most poker variants, each hand has two ways to win:

1. **Win at showdown** by making the best hand under the game’s rules.
2. **Win without showdown** by betting such that all other players fold.

Players compete for the **pot** (the chips wagered in the current hand).

## Core Mechanics (Applies to Most Variants)

### The Button and Positions

Poker is played “in position”:

- A **dealer button** rotates each hand to mark who is “dealer.”
- Betting order is based on the button, and position is strategically important.

Common position names (Texas Hold’em / Omaha):

- **Button (BTN)**: acts last post-flop.
- **Small Blind (SB)** and **Big Blind (BB)**: forced bets posted before cards.
- **Under the Gun (UTG)**: first to act pre-flop in multiway hands.

### Blinds and Antes

- **Blinds** are forced bets that create action: SB and BB.
- An **ante** (if used) is a small forced bet posted by all players.

### Streets / Betting Rounds

A hand consists of one or more betting rounds. The exact number depends on the variant.

In Texas Hold’em / Omaha, the common streets are:

1. **Pre-flop**: after players receive private cards.
2. **Flop**: after 3 community cards.
3. **Turn**: after 1 more community card.
4. **River**: after 1 final community card.
5. **Showdown** (if needed): remaining players reveal hands.

### Actions

On your turn, you can typically choose among:

- **Fold**: give up the hand.
- **Check**: bet 0 (only when there is no bet to call).
- **Call**: match the current bet.
- **Bet**: make the first wager in a betting round.
- **Raise**: increase the current bet.
- **All-in**: bet all remaining chips (treated as a bet/raise/call depending on context).

## Types of Poker Games

Poker variants are commonly grouped by *how cards are dealt* and *how hands are formed*.

### Community-Card Poker

Players use shared community cards plus their private cards to form a final hand.

#### Texas Hold’em

- Private cards: **2 hole cards**.
- Community cards: **5** (flop/turn/river).
- Final hand: best **5-card** hand using any combination of hole + community.

This is the most widely played modern variant.

#### Omaha

- Private cards: **4 hole cards**.
- Community cards: **5**.
- Final hand: must use **exactly 2** hole cards + **exactly 3** community cards.

Common sub-variants:

- **Pot-Limit Omaha (PLO)**: pot-limit betting.
- **Omaha Hi-Lo (8 or better)**: pot can be split between best high and best qualifying low.

### Draw Poker

Players receive a complete private hand and may replace (“draw”) some cards.

#### Five-Card Draw

- Private cards: **5**.
- Players may discard and draw replacements (often once).
- Few or no community cards.

### Stud Poker

Players receive a mix of face-up and face-down cards over multiple rounds.

#### Seven-Card Stud

- No community cards.
- Each player ends with **7 cards** (some visible), makes best **5-card** hand.

### Mixed Games

Formats like **H.O.R.S.E.** rotate through multiple variants to test broad skill.

## Betting Structures (Limit vs No-Limit vs Pot-Limit)

Betting structure determines how large bets and raises can be.

### Fixed-Limit

- Bets and raises are in fixed increments (e.g. $10/$20 limit).
- Number of raises per street may be capped depending on house rules.

### No-Limit

- You may bet/raise any amount up to your entire stack.
- This creates the possibility of large overbets and all-ins at any time.

### Pot-Limit

- The maximum bet/raise is the **current pot size** (with a specific calculation for raises).
- Most famously used in Pot-Limit Omaha.

## Betting Rules (Practical)

### Order of Action

- **Pre-flop (Hold’em/Omaha)**: first to act is usually left of the big blind (multiway). In heads-up, rules differ by format/house.
- **Post-flop (Hold’em/Omaha)**: first to act is typically left of the button.

### Checking vs Calling

- If there is **no bet**, you may **check** (stay in without adding chips).
- If there **is** a bet, you must **call**, **raise**, or **fold**.

### Minimum Bets and Minimum Raises

Common convention:

- A **bet** must be at least the table’s minimum (often the big blind in many games).
- A **raise** must be at least as large as the previous raise *size* (not the final bet amount).

Different rooms handle edge cases slightly differently, especially when all-ins occur.

### All-In and Side Pots

If a player goes all-in for less than the amount needed to call a bet:

- They are still eligible to win the portion of the pot they can cover.
- The table creates **side pots** so that deeper-stacked players can continue betting among themselves.

At showdown, pots are awarded from smallest (main pot) to largest (side pots), each among the eligible players.

### Showdown and Winning the Pot

If more than one player remains after the final betting round:

1. Remaining players reveal hands.
2. Best hand wins each pot.

If all but one player folds, the last player wins immediately (no showdown required).

## Hand Rankings (Standard 5-Card Hands)

Most poker variants use standard 5-card rankings (highest to lowest):

1. **Royal Flush**: A♠ K♠ Q♠ J♠ 10♠
2. **Straight Flush**: five in sequence, same suit (e.g. 9♥ 8♥ 7♥ 6♥ 5♥)
3. **Four of a Kind (Quads)**: A♦ A♣ A♥ A♠ + kicker
4. **Full House**: 7♣ 7♦ 7♠ + 2♥ 2♣
5. **Flush**: five same suit (not sequential)
6. **Straight**: five in sequence (mixed suits)
7. **Three of a Kind (Trips/Set)**: K♣ K♦ K♥ + two kickers
8. **Two Pair**: Q♠ Q♦ + 9♣ 9♥ + kicker
9. **One Pair**: J♠ J♥ + three kickers
10. **High Card**: best five cards with no made hand

### Tie-Breaking

- Hands are compared by their *rank category* first (e.g. any flush beats any straight).
- Within the same category, compare the relevant ranks (e.g. highest pair, then next kicker, etc.).
- **Suits do not break ties** in standard poker hand comparison.

## Glossary

- **Action**: any betting decision (check/call/bet/raise/fold).
- **All-in**: committing your entire stack.
- **Ante**: forced bet posted by all players.
- **Backdoor**: completing a draw that requires perfect runout (turn+river).
- **Bet**: first wager in a betting round.
- **Big Blind (BB)**: larger forced blind; also a unit of measurement.
- **Bluff**: betting with a weak hand to induce folds.
- **Board**: the community cards.
- **Button (Dealer)**: position marker; acts last post-flop.
- **Call**: match the current bet.
- **Check**: pass action with no bet to call.
- **Cold call**: calling a bet without having already contributed this round.
- **Draw**: a hand that can improve with future cards.
- **Equity**: your share of expected winnings given probabilities.
- **Fold**: abandon the hand.
- **Full ring / short-handed**: many players (8–10) vs few (typically 6-max).
- **Kicker**: side card(s) used to break ties.
- **Limp**: call the big blind pre-flop instead of raising.
- **Made hand**: a hand that is already strong without needing to improve.
- **Nuts**: the best possible hand at a given moment.
- **Outs**: unseen cards that improve your hand.
- **Pot**: total chips wagered in the current hand.
- **Pot odds**: ratio of call cost to pot size.
- **Position**: where you sit relative to the button; later position is generally better.
- **Raise**: increase the current bet.
- **Rake**: house fee (typically not modeled in pure simulations unless added).
- **Runout**: the sequence of community cards dealt.
- **Side pot**: extra pot created when a player is all-in.
- **Small Blind (SB)**: smaller forced blind.
- **Showdown**: revealing hands to determine winner(s).
- **Street**: a betting round (flop/turn/river, etc.).
- **Value bet**: betting with the intent to be called by worse hands.

## How This Relates to Maverick

Maverick’s engine is built around a state machine for community-card poker (Texas Hold’em rules by default).
In particular:

- Players act by returning a {class}`~maverick.playeraction.PlayerAction` with an {class}`~maverick.enums.ActionType`.
- Betting rounds and minimum raise semantics are enforced by {class}`~maverick.game.Game`.

Some procedures (like choosing the first button) may use deterministic tie-breakers (including suit order) for convenience, even though suits do not break ties in standard hand ranking.
